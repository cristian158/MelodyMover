Melody Mover, music organizer (and transcoder)


This program is a test to learn how to benefit from AI. It comes from an original problem I wanted to solve years ago. Now I make
it happen with a little help of my friends.

The program is designed to drag and drop folders with music to change their names, metadata and, optionally, transcode the audio
files of each album. I included the option of getting rid of files that sometimes comes after buying a digital album that I don't need.

It was decided python just for a matter of AI choice in the begining. We are trying Rust.
